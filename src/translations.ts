Obtendrás una puntuación de salud (1-5) y sugerencias inteligentes para mejorar tu comida.",
    
    faq3Question: "¿Qué tan precisos son mis objetivos diarios de calorías y macros?",
    faq3Answer: "Calculamos tus objetivos diarios de calorías y macronutrientes usando la ecuación de Mifflin–St Jeor, una de las fórmulas más confiables en la ciencia nutricional moderna, y la adaptamos a tu edad, peso, altura, género, nivel de actividad y objetivos específicos. Esta combinación de ciencia probada y personalización te da números en los que puedes confiar para ver progreso real. Y como la vida cambia, puedes ajustar fácilmente tus objetivos en la app en cualquier momento, asegurando que tu plan siempre se adapte a tu estilo de vida actual.",
    
    faq3bQuestion: "¿Qué tan preciso es el análisis de alimentos y comidas?",
    faq3bAnswer: "Nuestro análisis de comidas impulsado por IA reconoce instantáneamente lo que comes, estima tamaños de porción y entrega desgloses precisos de calorías y macros en segundos. Está alimentado por bases de datos nutricionales confiables y se vuelve aún más inteligente cuanto más lo usas, haciendo que el seguimiento sea rápido, fácil y sin estrés. Aunque los métodos de cocción y la calidad de los ingredientes pueden afectar ligeramente los resultados, nuestro análisis es lo suficientemente preciso para darte plena confianza en tus elecciones diarias, sin la molestia del seguimiento manual.",
    
    faq4Question: "¿Mis datos personales están seguros?",
